## üìÅ Updated Scripts

### scripts/create-project-issues.sh
The original script created issues from TODO.md but didn't align with README phases.

**Recommendation:** Keep this script as-is (historical), but document that GitHub issues are now aligned to README roadmap manually.

### Alternative: scripts/verify-roadmap-alignment.sh
Consider creating a verification script that checks:
- All README roadmap items have corresponding issues
- All issues are in correct milestones
- Milestone descriptions match README phases

## üìö Documentation Updates Needed

### 1. docs/index.md
Update the roadmap section to link to GitHub milestones:
```markdown
## Roadmap

ORCA development follows a phased approach. Track progress on our [GitHub project board](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/orca/projects/3).

### [Phase 1: MVP](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/orca/milestone/1) ‚úÖ Complete
Core Virtual Kubelet provider, basic pod-to-EC2 mapping...

### [Phase 2: Production](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/orca/milestone/2) üöß In Progress
GPU support, container runtime, kubectl logs/exec, spot instances...

[View all milestones ‚Üí](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/orca/milestones)
```

### 2. docs/getting-started/roadmap.md
Create a dedicated roadmap page with:
- Timeline visualization
- Feature details per phase
- Links to related issues
- Status updates

### 3. docs/development/contributing.md
Update contribution guide to reference aligned milestones:
```markdown
## Finding Issues to Work On

We organize work by phases:
- [v0.2-production](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/orca/milestone/2) - Current focus
- [Good First Issues](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/orca/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
```
